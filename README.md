# ABC
## Approximate Bayesian Computation

The Approximate Bayesian Computational Method is a technique employed in Bayesian statistics to address inference problems when the posterior distribution of model parameters cannot be directly calculated. This often occurs in the presence of complex models.

Instead of computing the posterior distribution of model parameters directly, ABC relies on generating random samples of data from the model under consideration, using various combinations of model parameters. These simulated data are then compared to real observational data. The goal is to identify combinations of model parameters that generate simulated data similar to the observed data. In other words, ABC estimates the posterior distribution of model parameters not through direct analytical calculations but through a Monte Carlo sampling procedure.

Below, I present the project on which I collaborated with Martina Dotti and Fabio Carando, colleagues from the MSc in Data Analytics for Business.

I hope you enjoy reading about our work, and I would appreciate feedback from those more knowledgeable and experienced than me!
